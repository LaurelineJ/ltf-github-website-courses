Generate course materials from [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
=====================================================================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------

General workflow

1.  Accept pull requests from contributors.
2.  Pull updated repository onto computer.
3.  Run [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) on Markdown files to generate
    websites and presentations. This can be automated using a "build
    tool" like [Gnu Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), which
    automatically detects which markdown files are changed, and runs the
    required Pandoc commands to generate content.
4.  Commit updated content and push back to repository.
